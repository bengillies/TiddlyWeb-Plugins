tiddlywebplugins.form

Provides a Serializer to transform HTML form-data into an object that can be put into the store.

Also adds POST support to the standard set of URLs and support for uploading binary files.

URLs with POST support are:

    /bags/foo/tiddlers
    /recipes/foo/tiddlers

To use, add tiddlywebplugins.form to your system_plugins in tiddlywebconfig.py.

You can then POST tiddlers to the server as follows:

1) set up an HTML form with any named elements. Supported names include:

    title - tiddler.title (this is optional and, depends upon which URL you POST to. Additionally, if you POST to /bags/foo/tiddlers without a title, you will get a UUID title instead).
    text - tiddler.text
    tags - tiddler.tags (this can be a list (eg checkboxes), or a string formatted as per standard TiddlyWiki tags).
    created - tiddler.created
    modified - tiddler.modified
    file - this is a special case and represents a binary file so must take the form of an HTML <input type="file" /> tag. If this is specified, you may include tags and a title, but anything else will be ignored.

2) Content type (enctype attribute in HTML form lingo) of the form must be either appilcation/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data (if uploading a binary file)

3) POST the form (ie - set the method to POST) to one of the above URLs (ie - set the action attribute), replacing foo as required.

4) Optionally specificy a redirect to redirect to a different page.

Example Usage:

say you want to POST a new tiddler to the bag "common", you might include the following HTML:

<form action="/bags/common/tiddlers" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="title" value="New Tiddler" />
<textarea name="text" rows="5" cols="40"></textarea>
<input type="text" name="tags" />
<input type="submit" value="Save" />
</form>

Alternatively, you may want to upload a binary file to the bag "common":

<form action="/bags/common/tiddlers" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="file" />
<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>


There is also a Binary Upload Plugin for TiddlyWiki designed specifically to work with tiddlyweplugins.form. You can find it at http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/BenGillies/TiddlyWeb/Plugins/Binary/tiddlers/BinaryUploadPlugin.tid
