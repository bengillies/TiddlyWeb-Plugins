Space

Space is a class that can be used to create a space

A space is defined as a common set of bags and recipes
that are all related in some way.

For example, a user space might have a private bag,
a public bag, and a recipe containing both of their
bags, and the system bag.

Or a project space might contain a project bag, a
bag containing some project specific config, a project
report bag, and two recipes.

This class is intended to provide an easy entry point
to accomplish this.

Note that it does not provide a user interface for creating
a space itself. That is left up to you.

Note also, that bags will not be replaced if they already exist.

See the examples folder for a couple of usage examples.
