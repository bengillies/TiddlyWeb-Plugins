BIMPORT

(short for binary import)

This is a plugin for twanager that lets you import files into the store as binary content.

This is particularly useful if you want to keep the content type of that file intact. Images are a
particularly good example of this requirement.

Usage:

twanager bimport <bag> <name> <URI>

this will import whatever lives at <URI> into <bag>. The resultant tiddler will be named <name>


CAUTION - If the content type of the file at <URI> is incorrect, the content type of the resultant
tiddler will also be incorrect. This is particularly evident in file:// URIs, which base their content
type on the file name extension. If you are importing via a file:// URI, be careful to use the correct
extension on the file that you are importing.
